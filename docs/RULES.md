# F1 Pick Champions — Rules & Scoring

> This document defines the rules, scoring system, and wager mechanics for **F1 Pick Champions**.  
> All rules apply equally to all participants.  
> Chaos is intentional. 

---

## 1. General Rules

- Each Formula 1 season is played independently.
- All wagers are **manual** and **locked before Qualifying** for each race.
- Once a wager is locked, **it cannot be edited**.
- Results are calculated only after **official race classification**.
- There are **no half-points**. Ever.

---

## 2. Wager Types

Each race allows the following wagers:

### 2.1 Podium Wager (Race)

You must pick **three drivers**:

- P1 — Race Winner
- P2 — Second Place
- P3 — Third Place

Drivers can be selected in **any order**, but points depend on accuracy.

---

### 2.2 Podium Joker 

- You may select **one driver** as your **Podium Joker**.
- If your Joker finishes **anywhere on the podium**, you score bonus points.
- Joker position **does not need** to match your podium picks.

---

### 2.3 Chaos Wagers 

Chaos wagers are **independent** from podium picks and reward unpredictability.

Currently supported Chaos wagers:

#### a) Chaos Pick — Driver DNF
- Pick **one driver**.
- If that driver **retires (DNF)** during the race, you score.

#### b) Chaos Pick — Number of DNFs
- Pick a **number between 1 and 22**.
- If the **total number of DNFs** in the race matches your pick, you score.

> Chaos wagers are optional but strongly encouraged.

## 4. Championships

### 4.1 Wager Championship 

- Sum of **all points** earned from:
  - Podium wagers
  - Joker bonuses
  - Chaos points
- This is the **main leaderboard**.

---

### 4.2 Chaos Championship 

- Tracks **only Chaos Points**.
- Runs **in parallel** to the main championship.
- Chaos points also count toward the Wager Championship.

> Yes, Chaos points count **twice**:
> - once for Chaos Championship  
> - once for Wager Championship  

Just like constructors scoring with two drivers.

---

## 5. Sprint Races

If a race weekend includes a **Sprint**:

- Sprint results are scored separately.
- No Joker applies unless explicitly enabled.
- Sprint points follow the same logic, but may use a reduced scale.

(Current implementation may vary by season.)

---

## 6. Season Championship Picks (Experimental)

Some seasons may include:

- Drivers’ Champion pick
- Constructors’ Champion pick

These are:
- Locked at season start
- Scored at season end
- Optional and experimental

---

## 7. Provisional Standings

- Championship tables shown during the season are **provisional**.
- Final standings are only confirmed after the last race of the season.

---

## 8. Fair Play & Spirit of the Game

- This is a **friendly competition**.
- No money is required to participate.
- Prizes (if any) are symbolic and agreed beforehand.
- The goal is fun, banter, and chaos — not profit.

---

## 9. Final Notes

- Rules may evolve between seasons.
- Any rule change must be announced **before the season starts**.
- If something breaks, blame Formula 1. Or Chaos.

Lights out… and away we go!
